'''
Each generator takes a sequence and returns a single element on each call.  The
order of the elements returned depends on the algorithm.  The generators do not
modify the sequence.

* When adding a generator, use the check_sequence decorator to ensure
  that the sequence passed is a shallow copy that you can modify in-place
  without any side effects.
* All generators must be infinite (i.e. they never end) or raise a StopIteration
  error when the sequence is exhausted.
* Random sequences have a hard dependency on Numpy (the built-in Python random
  module is suboptimal for scientific work).
* If your sequence contains mutable objects, then any modifications to the
  objects themselves will be reflected in the output of the generator.

Examples
--------
Modifying a sequence of immutable objects after passing it to the selector does
not affect the output of the selector:

    >>> sequence = [1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 0, 4]
    >>> choice = exact_order(sequence)
    >>> choice.next()
    1
    >>> sequence[1] = 2
    >>> sequence
    [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 0, 4]
    >>> choice.next()
    3

However, if you have a sequence that contains a mutable object (e.g. a list),
then modifications to the mutable object will alter the output of the selector:

    >>> sequence = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, 6]
    >>> choice = exact_order(sequence)
    >>> print choice.next()
    1
    >>> sequence[1][0] = -5
    >>> print choice.next()
    [-5, 3]

An error is also raised when an empty sequence is passed:

    >>> choice = ascending([])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Cannot use an empty sequence
